##Working Features
1. Ability to calculate the current, resistance, voltage, and power values for in series resistors.
2. Ability to calculate the current, resistance, voltage, and power values for in parallel resistors.
3. Ability to have 1 and 2 working at the same time such that we have in series sections inside parallel sections which are inside series sections and so.
4. Ability for a battery to have more than two paths directly connected to it.
5. Ability to place resistors, startJunctions, and endJunctions.
6. Ability to get the statistics of the resistors such as resistance, current, voltage, and power;
7. Ability to get the statistics of the resistors such as REQ, IEQ, VEQ, and PEQ which stand for current equivalence, resistance equivalence, voltage equivalence, and power equivalence.
8. Ability to save the current circuit on the screen into a text file. Data saved into the x,y position of all components, as well as their resistance, current, voltage, and power.
9. Ability to read text files to extract the data mentioned in item 8 and display the data.
10. Ability to remove the last added component and add further components.
11. Ability to access debugging information for the selected component if it is a resistor. 12. Debug information includes the resistance, current, voltage, power, x-position, y-position for the selected resistor, the component before it, and after it, in that order.
13. Ability to clear the board by pressing a key.
14. Ability to change the resistance of resistors in two different ways: typing the value / sliding the slider.
15. Ability to change the voltage of the entire curcuit in two different ways: typing the value / sliding the slider.
16. Putting 0 for voltage for the entire circuit and/or for individual resistors doesn't break anything.
17. Ability to have audio effects.

##Broken Features
1. Voltage / Current for startJunctions and endJunctions tend to be inaccuruate.
2. The debugging mode with junctions and battery will print out arrays that cover the screen, making them pretty much useless.
3. Spam clicking with the left or right mouse tends to cause freezing or crashing.
4. Very large numbers being directly inputted into the circuit voltage and individual resistor resistance tend to malfunction with the numbers not being registered accurately.
5. The system that prevents you from making bad connections such as connecting two components to a resistor sometimes fails and when you put the program in run mode, an error might occur. This system also might crash the program once in a while. ##Content Resources
