I created the two classes. I added all the initial variables and constructors that we need for the classes, initially. I added all the get methods needed for both classes. I added the addPrevious and allFollowing methods to the Component class and the add method to the Circuit class. I started to test all of these methods. I also created the Processing window we will use for our final demo.
