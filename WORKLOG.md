I created the two classes. I added all the initial variables and constructors that we need for the classes, initially. I added all the get methods needed for both classes. I added the addPrevious and allFollowing methods to the Component class and the add method to the Circuit class. I started to test all of these methods. I also created the Processing window we will use for our final demo.

I completed the calculate methods which are used to provide critical information about the individual components as well as the overall stats for the circuit, such as the total current (IEQ), the total resistance (REQ) and the total voltage (VEQ). I also added the resetSolved() method, which resets the solved status of all components, as well as the calculateStat method, which calculates the statistics for individual resistors (components).

Continued to work on a bug in the Processing window, which may have led to infinite recursion initially.
