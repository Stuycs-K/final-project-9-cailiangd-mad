I created the two classes. I added all the initial variables and constructors that we need for the classes, initially. I added all the get methods needed for both classes. I added the addPrevious and allFollowing methods to the Component class and the add method to the Circuit class. I started to test all of these methods. I also created the Processing window we will use for our final demo.

Start working on implamenting the interface we wanted to have in processing in processing. I also started thinking more about the user interface and how the user will interact with our program as well as writing a few additional methods to assist in the display and UI of our program.

### 5/24/2023

Finally figuring out what type of UI we want for the feature of connecting components together and implamenting the visual part of these connections and preparing to start working on the technical side of these connections to make them actually work.

I completed the calculate methods which are used to provide critical information about the individual components as well as the overall stats for the circuit, such as the total current (IEQ), the total resistance (REQ) and the total voltage (VEQ). I also added the resetSolved() method, which resets the solved status of all components, as well as the calculateStat method, which calculates the statistics for individual resistors (components).
